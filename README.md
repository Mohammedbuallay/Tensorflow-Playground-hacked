# tensorflow-playground-hacked


# Introduction
Through my journey in sharing my knowledge. Iâ€™ve used Tensorflow playground a lot, and people love it. However it has a limited dataset. So I have edited it and let it accept the highly dimensional data from the user and upload the data to better visualize their models and make the learning experience more hands-on.

# Install 

1- pip install flask
2- python3 main.py

# start

to start you can upload your data in CSV format. Inside the CSV you should have : 

label,x1,x2,.....
values,values,values,....

** keep in mind it will only accept -1 1 in the label

# TODO 

* make it more than two classes
